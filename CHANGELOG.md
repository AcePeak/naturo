## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Worktree-integrity import guard (opt-in)** — when `NATURO_EXPECTED_ROOT` is set, importing `naturo` (or running `python -m naturo`) fails loudly with a `WORKTREE_MISMATCH` error if the resolved package is not under that root. This catches a stale editable install (egg-link/`.pth`) silently shadowing the checkout under test with a sibling worktree's code, which would otherwise let runtime verification validate the wrong source and emit confident false verdicts. The guard is a no-op for ordinary installs (the variable is unset), so it only affects the multi-worktree agent harness that sets it. The fix for the install itself is environment-only and tracked separately ([#969](https://github.com/AcePeak/naturo/issues/969)); this is the code-only loud-failure companion ([#971](https://github.com/AcePeak/naturo/issues/971))

### Fixed
- **Optional-dependency install prompt no longer leaks into `-j` JSON output** — when a feature's optional package is missing (e.g. `pyvda` for `naturo desktop`), `naturo -j desktop list` previously printed the human prompt `Install it now? [Y/n]:` to stdout *before* the JSON envelope, so `json.loads` failed. `ensure_package` now takes a `json_output` flag and, in JSON mode, never prompts and never writes prose to stdout — emitting only the `{success: false, error: {code: "MISSING_DEPENDENCY", ...}}` envelope (exit 1). Gating is on the explicit flag rather than `sys.stdin.isatty()` because on Windows a DEVNULL-redirected child still reports a TTY, so a TTY check alone leaked for correctly-behaved agents too. The `@requires_package` decorator forwards the command's `json_output` automatically, so future optional-dep paths inherit the fix. Non-JSON behaviour is unchanged ([#869](https://github.com/AcePeak/naturo/issues/869))
- **Global `-j/--json` honoured on Click eager paths** — `naturo -j --version` now emits `{success: true, version: "..."}`, `naturo -j --help` emits `{success: true, help: {usage, commands, options}}`, and `naturo -j <unknown-command>` emits `{success: false, error: {code: "UNKNOWN_COMMAND", ...}}` with exit code 1 (runtime-error contract) instead of Click's plain-text banner and exit 2. Click resolves `--version`/`--help` and unknown commands before any naturo command runs, so the console-script entry point now wraps the group to close that gap; all other invocations are byte-for-byte unchanged. Top-level twin of the subcommand-level [#872](https://github.com/AcePeak/naturo/issues/872) ([#874](https://github.com/AcePeak/naturo/issues/874))
- **Top-level `count` in `list windows` and `list screens` JSON** — `naturo -j list windows` now emits `{success, windows, count}` and `naturo -j list screens` now emits `{success, monitors, count}` (both previously omitted `count`), matching their `window list` / `app windows` counterparts. Scripted wrappers no longer need to special-case these two endpoints. Text output is unchanged. Continues the read-command envelope normalization of [#876](https://github.com/AcePeak/naturo/issues/876) / [#977](https://github.com/AcePeak/naturo/issues/977) ([#980](https://github.com/AcePeak/naturo/issues/980))
- **Consistent JSON success envelope for `visual list` and `selector show`** — `naturo -j visual list` now emits `{success, baselines, count}` (was a bare `{baselines: [...]}`), and `naturo -j selector show <app>` now emits `{success, app, selectors, builtin, count}`; a nonexistent app fails loudly with `{success: false, error}` and exit 1 instead of being indistinguishable from an existing app with zero selectors. Completes the read-command envelope normalization started in [#876](https://github.com/AcePeak/naturo/issues/876) ([#977](https://github.com/AcePeak/naturo/issues/977))
- **Unicode capture paths regardless of native build** — `capture_screen` / `capture_window` again write to output paths containing non-ASCII characters (e.g. a Chinese/Japanese Windows username or folder in `%TEMP%`). The native core's Unicode fix ([#693](https://github.com/AcePeak/naturo/pull/693)) lives in source but the shipped DLL can lag a rebuild; the Python bridge now stages such captures through an ASCII-only temp file and moves the result to the requested path, so Unicode paths work independent of the native build ([#777](https://github.com/AcePeak/naturo/issues/777))
- **NO_DESKTOP_SESSION silent-failure cluster** — `app windows`, `dialog detect`, `taskbar list`, `tray list`, `wait --gone` (CLI) and `capture_screen`, `list_windows`, `list_apps`, `app_inspect`, `capture_window`, `list_monitors` (MCP) no longer return fabricated success (empty arrays, all-black PNGs, stale window lists) without a desktop session. The session guard is now enforced structurally at the shared entrypoint and these surfaces fail loudly with `NO_DESKTOP_SESSION` (exit 1 / `isError:true`) ([#885](https://github.com/AcePeak/naturo/issues/885), [#868](https://github.com/AcePeak/naturo/issues/868), [#875](https://github.com/AcePeak/naturo/issues/875), [#878](https://github.com/AcePeak/naturo/issues/878), [#883](https://github.com/AcePeak/naturo/issues/883), [#893](https://github.com/AcePeak/naturo/issues/893))
